I am unable to create a category in my wholesale clothing store app. The frontend form submits correctly, but the request fails, and the category is not inserted into the database.

Current Implementation:
Frontend (client/src/pages/admin/dashboard.tsx):

The CategoryManagement component contains a form for name and price.
On submission, it validates inputs and calls createCategoryMutation.
createCategoryMutation sends a POST request to "/api/categories" using apiRequest.
Backend (server/routes.ts):

The POST "/api/categories" route is protected by requireAdmin middleware.
The request body is validated using insertCategorySchema from shared/schema.ts.
If validation passes, it calls storage.createCategory().
Database (server/storage.ts):

createCategory() inserts the data into the categories table using Drizzle ORM.
The categories schema requires name (unique) and defaultPrice (integer).
Expected Behavior:
When a valid category name and price are entered, the category should be created successfully.
Fix Needed:
Debug why the request fails:

Log the raw request body received in POST /api/categories.
Ensure req.body is correctly parsed and structured.
Check JSON parsing:

Ensure express.json() middleware is present to parse incoming JSON requests.
Validate that defaultPrice is correctly formatted:

Confirm that the frontend sends it as a number (not a string).
Modify insertCategorySchema to log defaultPrice before validation.
Check for unique name constraints:

Ensure database constraints allow insertion.
Provide proper error messages:

If validation fails, return detailed errors instead of a generic 400 response.
Action Items for Replit:
Investigate why the request is failing at /api/categories.
Ensure defaultPrice is received as an integer and not rejected by validation.
Verify requireAdmin middleware isnâ€™t blocking the request incorrectly.
Ensure the createCategory() function correctly executes the database insertion.
Please debug the issue and ensure categories can be created successfully. Let me know what logs reveal.
