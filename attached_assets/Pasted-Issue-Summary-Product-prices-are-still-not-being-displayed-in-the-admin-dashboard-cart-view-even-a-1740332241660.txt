Issue Summary:
Product prices are still not being displayed in the admin dashboard cart view, even after fixing cart submissions.
The total price is incorrect because individual product prices are missing.
Expected Behavior:
Each submitted cart should store and display the correct product prices in the admin dashboard.
The total price should be accurately calculated based on the stored prices.
Prices should be retrieved from the database and displayed in the admin cart view.
Debugging & Fixes Needed:
1. Verify That Product Prices Are Being Stored in the Database
When a cart is submitted, the product price at that time should be saved to ensure accuracy.
If the database only stores productId but not price, the admin dashboard will not have price data to display.
✅ Debugging Steps:

Run a database query to check if product prices are stored with each cart entry.
If prices are missing, ensure that the backend correctly saves product prices when inserting the cart data.
2. Ensure That the API Returns Product Prices When Fetching Submitted Carts
The API response for /api/admin/carts should include stored product prices.
If the response does not include prices, the frontend cannot display them in the admin dashboard.
✅ Debugging Steps:

Log the API response in DevTools (Network tab > Fetch/XHR) to check if product prices are returned.
If the API response is missing prices, update the backend query to include stored prices.
3. Ensure the Frontend Uses the Correct Price Field
The admin dashboard cart view should map the correct price field from the API response.
If the frontend expects product.price but the API returns stored_price, it may result in missing prices.
✅ Debugging Steps:

Log the cart data received by the frontend (console.log(cartData)).
Ensure the frontend extracts and displays the correct price field from the API response.
4. Ensure Total Price Is Calculated Correctly
The total price should be calculated using stored product prices, not live product prices from the catalog.
Ensure that the total updates dynamically based on the retrieved prices.
✅ Debugging Steps:

Log total price calculations in the frontend to ensure the correct price field is used.
If the total remains 0, update the calculation to use stored product prices instead of defaulting to 0.
