Project Specification: Custom Clothing Store App for Wholesale Business
This project involves building a custom clothing store web application with client-facing and admin-facing user interfaces (UI). The app will primarily serve as an image gallery for customers to browse products and create wholesale orders. Below are the detailed specifications:

Key Features:
Client-Facing UI

Displays a gallery of products with image-based listings.
Each product listing can contain multiple images for a detailed view.
Customers can select multiple products and add them to their cart to create an order.
Multiple customers can select the same product for different orders simultaneously.
Products that are marked as unavailable by the admin should still be visible in the gallery but not selectable for orders.
Customers can review their cart before submitting an order.
Admin-Facing UI

Provides a dashboard for the admin to manage product listings and view customer orders.
Admin should be able to upload new product listings with multiple images per product.
Admin can set the availability status of each product:
Available: Visible and selectable by customers.
Unavailable: Still visible in the product gallery but not selectable by customers.
Admin should be able to view all customer orders, including product selections and relevant order details.
Functional Requirements:
Product Listings:

Each product listing should support multiple images.
Listings should include a title/description field and an availability toggle (available/unavailable).
Customer Order Process:

Customers should be able to browse the product gallery, select products, and add items to their cart.
Once items are added, the customer can review and submit their order.
Order Management (Admin UI):

Admin should have access to a list of all submitted orders.
Orders should include customer information and selected products for easy reference.
Technical Considerations:
Tech Stack: Ensure compatibility with modern web standards (React, Node.js, etc.).
Scalability: The app should handle multiple concurrent users without performance issues.
Security: Ensure customer data is handled securely, especially during the order process.
User Experience (UX) Considerations:
Client UI:

Simple, clean, and easy to navigate. Focus on a visual gallery with product images.
Mobile-friendly and responsive design for easy browsing on various devices.
Admin UI:

Intuitive and user-friendly dashboard for managing listings and reviewing orders.
